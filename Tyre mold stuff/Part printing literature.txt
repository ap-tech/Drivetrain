The material I use here is PETG printed at 240°C and 65°C for the bed, The printer is a Crealty CR10Pro and The make of the filament is Prima, The infill is 15% and the perimeter is 4 the slicer is PrusaSlicer.

Orientation, Support material, Print time, And even extra PrusaSlicer settings are in the pics I supply in this folder.

As for, If this will work with PLA? I don’t know how DIY silicone reacts with PLA, You may have to do some testing yourself.

Happy Printing :)
